## ERC
* ERC is an acronym that stands for Ethereum Request for Comments. 
* ERCs are application-level standards for Ethereum and can include token standards, name registries, library formats etc.
* Common ERC standards define a required set of functions for a token type, allowing applications and smart contracts to interact with them in a predictable way.
* Most common ERC standard used is ERC-20, a type of standard that defines the creation, use and exchange of Ethereum-based tokens.

## ERC-20: Token Standard 
:::note ERC-20
- ERC: 20
- Title: Token standard
- Type: Informational
- Created: 19-11-2015
- Resolution: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Standardized_Contract_APIs
:::

:::success Motivation
A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.

## ERC-721
:::note ERC-721
* EIP: ERC-721
* Title: Non-fungible Token Standard
* Author: Dieter Shirley <dete@axiomzen.co>
* Type: Standard
* Created: 2017-09-20
:::

:::success motivation
A standard interface for non-fungible tokens (NFT), also known as deeds. A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on Ethereum. We provide for simple ERC-721 smart contracts as well as contracts that track an arbitrarily large number of NFTs. Additional applications are discussed below.
